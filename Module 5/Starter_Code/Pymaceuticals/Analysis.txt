Several conclusions can be drawn from the data analysis visualization of the mouse treatment.
1. The heavier the mouse is in terms of weight, the larger the turmor volume is on average when we observe the treatment of mouse under the drug regimen Capomulin
2. The Tumor voulme decreases longer the mouse is treated with a durg, as visualised by the tumor volume vs timpoint graph of mouse l509 under the drug capomulin
3. Tumor volume of mice teated under the drugs Infubinol and Cefatamin was much larger in comparison with mice treated under the drug Capomulin and Ramicane
4. Gender distribution of mice treated remained on average equal between genders where the were split 50/50 between male and female mouse
